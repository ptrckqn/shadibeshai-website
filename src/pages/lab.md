        Psychology under the supervision of Dr. Beshai. Her research was focused
        on narrowing down the concept of mindfulness by defining the borderlines
        between mindfulness and the two related terms, non-attachment and
        equanimity in an effort to determine where each interconnect. Her
        research will also be testing to see if these terms exhibit a
        correlation between the symptoms of anxiety and depression. The results
        of her research project will be useful in the process of developing an
        operational definition of mindfulness. They will also be beneficial in
        indicating the effectiveness of mindfulness meditation in reducing
        symptoms of anxiety and depression. She is interested in continuing to
        do research on the mental health effects of practicing mindfulness
