        at the University of Montreal. Her research has focused on the impact of
        social isolation and loneliness on physical, mental, and cognitive
        health outcomes, particularly among frail older adults, and how cohort
        trends and social change affect later-life health profiles. As a
        postdoctoral fellow, she was involved in creating a brief
        mindfulness-based intervention to improve the mental well-being of

    - title: Sarah Gulash
      sub: Former Honours Student
      body: "Sarah Gulash (she/her) completed her BSc Honours degree in psychology
        under the supervision of Dr. Beshai. Her research focused on perceptions
        of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) and she examined whether
        various personality, demographic, and clinical factors predict these
        perceptions. This research will help identify whether an individual is
        likely to perceive MBIs favourably based on their dispositions. This
        will lead to future research on the relationship between MBI perceptions
        and the outcomes or success of MBIs. She is hoping to pursue graduate
        studies in clinical psychology. "

      image: /uploads/jenna-maierhoffer.jpg
      body: Jenna completed her final year in Psychology in 2022, with an Honours in
        Psychology under the supervision of Dr. Beshai. Her research was focused
        on narrowing down the concept of mindfulness by defining the borderlines
        between mindfulness and the two related terms, non-attachment and
        equanimity in an effort to determine where each interconnect. Her
        research will also be testing to see if these terms exhibit a
        correlation between the symptoms of anxiety and depression. The results
        of her research project will be useful in the process of developing an
        operational definition of mindfulness. They will also be beneficial in
        indicating the effectiveness of mindfulness meditation in reducing
        symptoms of anxiety and depression. She is interested in continuing to
        do research on the mental health effects of practicing mindfulness
        meditation.
